## Unified Cyber Defense Platform

This repository provides a starter template for creating applications using Next.js (App Router) and AWS Amplify, emphasizing easy setup for authentication, API, and database capabilities.

## Overview

This template equips you with a foundational Next.js application integrated with AWS Amplify, streamlined for scalability and performance. It is ideal for developers looking to jumpstart their project with pre-configured AWS services like Cognito, AppSync, and DynamoDB.

## Features

- **Authentication**: Setup with Amazon Cognito for secure user authentication.
- **API**: Ready-to-use GraphQL endpoint with AWS AppSync.
- **Database**: Real-time database powered by Amazon DynamoDB.
- **Real-time Threat Detection**: AI-powered monitoring identifies suspicious activity as it happens, enabling rapid response and preventing potential breaches.
- **Unified Data Platform**: Consolidates security data from various sources into a centralized data lake, providing a single source of truth.
- **Endpoint Protection (EDR)**: Provides comprehensive protection for endpoint devices (computers, mobile devices, servers) against malware, ransomware, and other threats.
- **Data as a Service (DaaS)**: Offers processed and structured security data in open formats, allowing for seamless integration with existing data analytics tools and platforms.
- **Automated Response**: Automates threat containment and mitigation actions, such as isolating affected devices and blocking malicious processes.
- **Intelligent Action Center**: Provides a centralized dashboard for managing security incidents, tracking threat status, and initiating response actions.
- **Email and Messaging Integration**: Scans emails and text messages for phishing attempts, scams, and other malicious content.
- **Trusted Source Intelligence**: Provides access to a curated database of trusted URLs and IPs, helping to identify and block known malicious actors.
